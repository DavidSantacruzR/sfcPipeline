<h1>DATA PIPELINE EXAMPLE:</h1>

In this example, we're collecting financial statements publicly available from the financial regulation authority
of Colombia. After fetching all the required information, we're making a simple data cleaning and pushing it to an
either a local or a server SQL database.

All the data can be manually collected from: https://www.superfinanciera.gov.co/jsp/index.jsf

It is required that to run this example, create environment variables with all the credentials required to connect
